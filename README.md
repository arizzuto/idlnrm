This repository is (one version of) and IDL astronomy aperture-masking interferometry 
code which has been called the "Sydney code" among other things.

In approximately 2004, several aperture-masking projects behind adaptive optics were beginning, including PHARO, NIRC2 and ZORAO (which never acquired data). These projects came together to create a single IDL pipeline, sharing some features with the NIRC aperture-masking code (e.g. data cleaning algorithms) and adding new features.

This code has had many authors over the years, including Tom Evans, Michael Ireland, James Lloyd, Frantz Martinache, John Monnier, Paul Stewart and Peter Tuthill. There is no clear citation for the work, however the first papers to make serious use of the pipeline were probably: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...650L.131L (PHARO) http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...679..762K (NIRC2) http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...744..120E (CONICA)
